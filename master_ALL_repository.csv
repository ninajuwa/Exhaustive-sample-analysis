Moving observer; The metaphor of listening / experiencing a musical piece is a journey through the piece is extended throughout the whole passage; the conceptualisation has aspects of both time as a landscape and the event structure metpahor. THERE are 2 over-arching metaphors  in the text: music is space / a cathedrale  through which an observer moves and thus discovers and understands the piece; and music is a river which propels the listener through the piece. As a matter of convenience, I will classify the first metaphor as relfecting temporal conceptual metaphors because the spatial aspect of music as a landscape is emphasised and the metaphors functions to describe passages in the piece as locations that a moving observer moves relative to. I will classify the 2nd metaphor as an instance of the ESM because in this metaphor the observer becomes passive and it is music which is conceptualised as a force (cf. Causes are forces) propelling the observer through the piece.
